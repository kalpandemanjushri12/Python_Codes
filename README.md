This respository consist of few set of python codes which is used in bioinformatics
1. The Python script (DNA_TO_RNA) simulates the transcription process, converting a DNA sequence into its corresponding RNA sequence. In biological systems, transcription is a vital step in gene expression, where DNA is transcribed into RNA, replacing Thymine (T) with Uracil (U). This will takes a DNA sequence as input and outputs the transcribed RNA sequence.

2. The Python script(k-mer_occurence) allows users to extract and analyze k-mers (subsequences of length k) from a given DNA sequence. This is useful for identifying recurring patterns, analyzing genetic motifs, and studying sequence complexity in biological data.

3. The Python script(Nucloetide_Count)is a simple Python function that counts the occurrences of each nucleotide (A, C, G, T) in a given DNA sequence. By counting the frequency of each nucleotide, one can gain insight into the composition of a DNA sequence, which is essential in various genomic studies, such as detecting mutations, genetic variation, or understanding the overall sequence structure.
