This respository consist of few set of python codes which is used in bioinformatics-

1. The Python script (DNA_TO_RNA) simulates the transcription process, converting a DNA sequence into its corresponding RNA sequence. In biological systems, transcription is a vital step in gene expression, where DNA is transcribed into RNA, replacing Thymine (T) with Uracil (U). This will takes a DNA sequence as input and outputs the transcribed RNA sequence.

2. The Python script (Nucloetide_Count)is a simple Python function that counts the occurrences of each nucleotide (A, C, G, T) in a given DNA sequence. By counting the frequency of each nucleotide, one can gain insight into the composition of a DNA sequence, which is essential in various genomic studies, such as detecting mutations, genetic variation, or understanding the overall sequence structure.

3. The Python script (Complement_DNA) required in various bioinformatics analyses, such as primer design and sequence alignment. As DNA is double stranded and shares complimentary base pairing with corresponding nucleotide hence it is necessary to study complement .
